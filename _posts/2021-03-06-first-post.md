### First blog post 

Hello, I'm Colby. This is the first blog post on my new website! Just a bit about me: I currently work as a systems analyst at [UPMC](https://upmc.com) where I administer enterprise software for their engineering & maintenance department. I am also pursuing a second bachelors in computer science, which I'm slated to finish early next year. 

I'm not sure how often I will post, but I plan to use this blog as a catch-all for whatever I feel like writing about: programming projects, solutions technical problems, career stuff, personal musings, or whatever else I find interesting. 

I have a few javascript projects hosted in the projects section, including the hero animation on my landing page. You can interact with them there. I'll be adding other projects I've been working on soon.

Feel free to connect by emailing me or adding me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-king-940a3790). My [Github profile](https://github.com/cmk97) is here.
