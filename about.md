### Why I made this site
Hello! I am Colby. I'm fascinated by a lot of stuff. And I tend to have a compulsion to understand the things that are interesting to me, so I thought starting this blog would be a fun way to write about and engage with whatever I'm trying to learn. 


### What I do
I currently work as a systems analyst at UPMC where I administer several enterprise software systems. When I am not working, you'll find me programming, working on my second bachlors degree, building websites for my friends, or providing tech support to my mom.
